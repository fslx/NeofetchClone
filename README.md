# Neofetch clone
After Neofetch was discontinued, I wanted to attempt to implement my own clone from scratch in C as I am already learning the langauge.
Built with GCC

# Usage
```sh
# todo: add support for make & cmake
make Neofetch_Clone

# Clang
clang main.c -o a.out
./a.out

# GCC / 
gcc main.c -o a.out
./a.out
```
